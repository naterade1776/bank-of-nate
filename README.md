# bank-of-nate
A simple terminal application for bank management. Create, view, and add bank records.

This application can:
-Create Records
-View Records
-Modify Records

Application also checks input for name collisions, so no two records can have the same file name. Credentials are also 
required to create or modify an account.

UN: admin

-Password for admin functions: 0000

I advise you compile this application into it's own directory, since it generates text files every time you create a record.
